# hello-world
My first git repository, which will be used for storing ideas, references, and notes for future projects.

Hello, I'm not a beginner developer, but I'm just starting out using GitHub to store projects that I create and to contribute to other open source projects. I've still got a lot to learn, but getting GitHub down is a huge step :)

Future me: still a scrub
